        <h1 class="heading">BENEFITS OF VEGETABLES</h1>
        <p class="container1"> <img class="conimg" src="vege.png" alt="">   
            Vegetable is a broad term that refers to the edible parts of plants, which are usually their leaves, roots, fruits, or seeds. Vegetables are a staple food across the world and are a fundamental part of modern agriculture. 
            Since they’re low in calories but high in nutrients, most health experts recommend that you consume vegetables daily. There’s a scientific consensus that a balanced, rotating diet of different varieties of vegetables is one of the best ways to source nutrients from your food starting at a young age.

        <p class="container1a"> <img class="conimg1" src="vege2.png" alt="">
                Vegetables are full of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that provide many important health benefits to your body. For instance, carrots are known for being very high in vitamin A, which plays an important role in eye health, as you grow older.

        <h1 class="heading-2">BENEFITS OF FRUITS</h1>
        <p class="container1"> <img class="conimg" src="fruit.png" alt="">   
            Fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, and they are high in fiber. Fruits also provide a wide range of health-boosting antioxidants, including flavonoids.

Eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables can reduce a person’s risk of developing heart disease, cancer, inflammation, and diabetes. Citrus fruits and berries may be especially powerful for preventing disease.

This article looks at the nutrition and the many and varied health benefits of these and other fruits.

            Fruit also provides a rich resource of nutrients which can be seen from their bright colours! The colour, smell and taste of a fruit comes from the plant’s phytochemicals. These plant-chemicals are believed to offer a wide range of health benefits, including those with antioxidants properties, carotenoid from orange-coloured fruits, and anthocyanin from red, blue and purple coloured fruit and vegetables.
